    "#### Application Programming Interface (API) is a software interface that allows two applications to interact with each other without any user intervention. API is a collection of software functions and procedures. In simple terms, API means a software code that can be accessed or executed. API is defined as a code that helps two different software’s to communicate and exchange data with each other. It offers products or services to communicate with other products and services without having to know how they are implemented.\n",
    "#### Google Maps is a popular app on billions of mobile devices around the world, but we are probably aware of at least a few dozen other apps that use Google Maps APIs to pull customized location data, send directions, and analyze all types of location data that can help businesses provide better services and establish streamlined connections with suppliers, customers, delivery services, and more."

    "#### REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer and API stands for Application Program Interface. REST is a software architectural style that defines the set of rules to be used for creating web services. Web services which follow the REST architectural style are known as RESTful web services. It allows requesting systems to access and manipulate web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of rules. Interaction in REST based systems happen through Internet’s Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Architectural Constraints of RESTful API: There are five architectural constraints which makes any web service\n",

    "1. SOAP is a communication protocol designed to communicate via Internet and it can extend HTTP for XML messaging.\n",
    "2. SOAP provides data transport for Web services. It can exchange complete documents or call a remote procedure.\n",
    "3. SOAP is the XML way of defining what information is sent and how, it is platform and language independent. It can be used for broadcasting a message."
