    "### State advantages and disadvantages of multithreading\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "#### 1. Multithreading in an interactive application enables a program to continue running even if a section is blocked or executing a lengthy process, increasing user responsiveness.\n",
    "#### 2. Threads share the memory and resources of the process they belong to which permits an app to execute multiple code threads in the same address space.\n",
    "#### 3. Threads share a memory with the process to which they belong, establishing and context switching threads is more cost-effective. In general, generating and managing processes takes far more time than threads.\n",
    "#### 4. Multithreading on multiple CPU machines increases parallelism.\n",
    "#### 5. Thread synchronization functions could be used to improve inter-process communication. Multithreading might be considerably amplified in a multiprocessor architecture, where every thread could execute in parallel on a distinct processor. It enhances concurrency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "#### 1. It needs more careful synchronization.\n",
    "#### 2. It can consume a large space of stocks of blocked threads.\n",
    "#### 3. It needs support for thread or process.\n",
    "#### 4. If a parent process has several threads for proper process functioning, the child processes should also be multithreaded because they may be required.\n",
    "#### 5. It imposes context switching overhead."
